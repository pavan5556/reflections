Reflection: We can easily know what iterations the whole file has went through.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Reflection: Pros: We can save the code after a logical change.
cons: Due to neglegence or some error, if the code is not saved then the information is lost.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Reflection: It depends on what you are saving. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Reflections: git log will display the commits and git diff will display the changes between each commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
